Basic Machine Learning Application.

Note: This is a basic linear regression app based on a cost function and gradient descent algorithm, one of the most common algorithm of Machine Learning.

Steps:
-	With the Open File Button , ctrl + o  select the *txt file to analysis.
-	Fill out the label(x) and label(y) to have axes descriptions.
-	Fill out the initial values for examples: theta could be started with 0 , Number of interactions 1500 and the alpha   values could be taken in a range from 0.001 to 0.2 given outside this range the cost function does not converge.
-	Finally click on Calculate Theta.
-	A Line over a scatter plot shows and the theta 0 and theta 1 have been optimized.
-	If there is any change in initial theta values will be possible to observe the Cost Function changes.
-	Additionally, the application could get a predicted value based on the adjusted theta.
